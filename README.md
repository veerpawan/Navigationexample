Introduction
The Navigation Architecture Component simplifies implementing navigation, while also helping you visualize your app's navigation flow. The library provides a number of benefits, including:

Automatic handling of fragment transactions
Correctly handling up and back by default
Default behaviors for animations and transitions
Deep linking as a first class operation
Implementing navigation UI patterns (like navigation drawers and bottom nav) with little additional work
Type safety when passing information while navigating
Android Studio tooling for visualizing and editing the navigation flow of an app
